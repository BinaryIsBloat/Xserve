# Xserve (beta)
A server application written in pure Python without any bullshit (that is at least our aim. Though the beta state of the application might cause a little more bullshit than intended, but those issues should be resolved eventually)
The server should be able to run very much dependency-free, so that any person with a Python interpreter can run it out of the box. The server should also support it's own scripting language, the standards of which will be published later.

## ToDo-List (updated last on the 7th of August, 2022)

 - [x] Make socket creation function
 - [x] Make socket removal function
 - [x] Make socket listen function
 - [x] Make buffer library
 - [ ] Debug buffer library
 - [x] Make data input function
 - [ ] Debug data input function
 - [ ] Make a parser for client headers
 - [x] Make a logger library for all operations
 - [ ] Implement the data functions store, free and return
 - [ ] Debug all data functions
 - [ ] Check for code vulnerabilities

This list is in progress and may be expanded or trimmed at any given moment. Time will tell in which direction the server will go, for now the emphasize lies on making the application actually work.
