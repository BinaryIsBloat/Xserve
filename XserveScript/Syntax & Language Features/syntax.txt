Introduction
************

  The Xserve Script 1 programming language is a superset of the BinaryIsBloat "Anarchie" language, therefore making it
  part of the "Hirarchie" language group developed by the BinaryIsBloat-community. The language is compiled to bytecode
  and executed by the server software. It is up to the server software to decide which additional libraries it is willing
  to provide, though the standard library is mandatory as it contains most of the important definitions that allow for
  writing fast and robust code. The server software also has to emulate the Xserve API in some way, as the scripting
  language simply behaves like a wrapper for said API. As part of the "Hirarchie" language group, it has a nested context
  manager which is focused around the virtual file system that serves the URIs and around the diffrent protocols the server
  should support. The most common protocols are stored in the BuiltIn scope, such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, Gopher, etc. Other
  protocols may be included via external libraries or may be defined locally. URIs may be mapped to exisiting ressources
  on the file system or they may link to dynamic content. The latter may be achieved through the stream data type, which
  is also part of the core API. Streams may be created in memory but behave like file objects, therefore they may be used
  as files on the virtual file system. The most common functions that may be used for dynamic content creation are stored
  in the standard libary. That includes among others PHP, Python, Server-side HTML and the native Xserve Advanced HTML 1
  format, which extends the HTML format simmilarly to PHP by adding special comment tags to an HTML file which contain
  Xserve Script 1-ML instructions (The appended -ML means Markup Language). Said comment tags are written like <!XSERVE 1 {...}>
  where the curly braces contain the main body of the instruction set.
