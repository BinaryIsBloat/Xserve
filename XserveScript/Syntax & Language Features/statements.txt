General Statements:
*******************

    VERSION <major>.<minor> -
        Sets the script version. Must be the first non-comment instruction.

    LET const|mut|fixed <reference> = <value> -> <data-type> -
        Assigns a value to a variable. Multiple variables may be defined in a single line by delimiting the references and values
        with commas. The LET may be followed by either const to create a constant instead of a variable, by mut to create a mutable
        variable which values may be changed or fixed which creates an immutable variable. If no option is given, fixed is assumed.
        The data type declaration is optional but may be used to explicitly set the data structure of the variable. It is also possible
        to only set the data type and define the value elsewhere. In this case, the variable can only be mut or fixed. If it is defined
        as fixed, the next assignment will be responsible for setting the definitive value of the variable.
    See also: "variables & references.txt", "data structures & operators.txt"

    DEL <reference> -
        Removes variables using the garbage collector.

    PROTO <network-protocol> {...} -
        Defines the protocol specifications that should be used for all sub-instructions.

    LOG <string> <severity> -
        Prints a string to the server logs. Severity may be set to 0 (Info), 1 (Warning), 2 (Error) and 3 (Verbose).

    ROOT <directory> -
        Defines the root directory of the context. All directory references inside this context will be relative to this directory,
        except for those that have been marked as absolute.


Library Statements:
*******************

    INCLUDE <library> IMPORTS <definitions> -> <scope> -
        Includes definitions from an external library. Library must be provided as string representing the path to the literal file.
        The IMPORTS statement is optional and may be used to only import specific definitions from the library. The -> operator may
        be used to import certain definitions into a specific scope instead of into the self scope. Lists and wildcards are allowed,
        though unenclosed commata will be interpreted as a new library.

    EXPORT <definition> -
        Exports a definition so that it may be imported via the INCLUDE and USING statement.

    PURGE <library> -
        Removes all definitions that have been included from the specified library.

    USING <scope> -
        Imports definitions from a scope directly into the current context. The scope is no longer required if directly imported.

    DROP <scope> -
        Drops the definitions that have been imported with the USING statement.


Macro Statements:
*****************

    SET <macro>(<argv>) -
        Enables a certain compiler macro. Macros tweak the way the compiler operates and may be used to change the default settings
        for certain contexts. Macros should be set carefully, as they may affect the safety of your code.

    UNSET <macro> -
        Disable/reset a certain compiler macro.

    MACRO <macro>(<argv>) {...} -
        The base statement for creating a new compiler macro.


Definition Statements:
**********************

    DEFINE <scope> {...} -
        Base context for creating a new definition. Definitions function as containers for data types, values, contexts and other
        definitions. Every nested definition creates a new scope which may be resolved with the scope operator.

    CONTEXT <context-name> PARENT (<parent-context>) {...} -
        Base context for creating a new context. The CONTEXT statement is supposed to provide an easier wrapper around the more complex
        statement constructor which is available through STRUCT. The context statement emulates the context behavior of the parent context
        and therefore differs from the STRUCT approach as no new context data type is created in the process.

    PRIVATE <scope> -
        Anything in the private scope is only available inside the context of the DEFINE statement. There is no way to access this
        scope through external calls, such as the INCLUDE, USING or EXPORT statements.


Conditional Statements:
***********************

    IF <condition> {...} ELSIF <condition> {...} ELSE {...} -
        Checks wether a condition is true or false. The ELSE block is optional and gets executed if the condition is not met. Multiple
        conditions may be written next to each other by using the ELSIF statement which is an alias for ELSE {IF {...}} and makes the
        code more readable and visually appealing.

    SWITCH <key> {CASE <key> {...} DEFAULT {...}} -
        Matches a key against multiple values and run through the specific instructionset if a match is found.
        If none of the keys match the values, the DEFAULT statement is called.

    Note: Most contexts have their own modified condition constructors which usually have certain advantages over the
    generalized conditional statements.


Exception Statements:
*********************

    TRY {...} CATCH <exception> {...} NOERR {...} FINALLY {...} -
        Attempts to run through an instructionset and call the CATCH statement if an error is encountered on
        runtime. The NOERR statement is called if the TRY statement did not throw any errors on runtime. The
        FINALLY statement is called no matter what happens or wether the exception is caucht or not.

    THROW <exception>(<argv>) -
        Throws an exception. If it isn't handled inside a TRY block, the exception will be seen as an error and
        the program will refuse to proceed. Arguments are optional and may be used to provide additional information
        about the exception.


Loop Statements:
****************

    WHILE <condition> {...} NOBREAK {...} -
        Loops through the block of instructions while the condition is true. The NOBREAK block is optional and will
        only be called if the condition is false. If the loop was closed using a BREAK statement, the NOBREAK statement
        will be ignored.

    FOR <variable> IN <iter> {...} NOBREAK {...} -
        Runs through the block of instructions until all iterations of the variable have finished. NOBREAK behaves the
        same as with the WHILE statement.

    BREAK -
        Breaks out of the loop.

    CONTINUE -
        Jumps to the beginning of the loop.

    GOTO <mark> -
        Jumps to the specified mark.

    MARK <mark> -
        Creates a mark with the specified name at the position of the statement.


Functional Statements:
**********************

    FUNCT static|caller <function-name>(<argv>) {...} -
        Creates a new function which takes arguments and has local variable definiton. If the funtion is declared as
        static, it does not take any arguments and does not require any () to be called. By default, the function is
        declared as caller function which takes arguments and is called via the () parameters.

    CALL <function>(<argv>) -
        Calls a function. A wrapper for functions that follows the rules and syntax of a statement. The () are optional
        and may be used to pass arguments to the function.

    RETURN <value> -
        Returns a value from the function. If no RETURN statement is called at the end of the function, the value
        is none.


Data Constructor Statements:
****************************

    STRUCT <name> SUBSET <parent-constructor> {...} -
        The base context for creating a new data constructor. SUBSET is optional and may be used to define properties
        that should be inherited from other data types.

    CONTAIN {...} -
        This is the context which contains all data which is encapsulated in the data type. The data type has to be
        provided for all keys in this context.

    SYNTAX {...} -
        This context is used to store the syntax features of the data type. This includes operators, statements and other
        more specific features, such as the short constructor (an example for a short constructor would be the surrounding
        double quotes for creating new strings). The syntax usually only becomes crucial for the creation of complex structures
        that require more than the default data type syntax.

    SCOPE {...} -
        This is the context which contains all public functions and definitions. It is only possible to manipulate data
        of an object through the functions that have been defined in SCOPE. The SCOPE context must contain a !new function
        if it has the purpose of a new data type. Purely functional constructors, such as those for statements, don't require
        this function. The assign function is automatically called as soon as a new variable with this data type is created.
        Other functions for SCOPE are listed in the 'data constructors.txt' document.

Convenience Statements:
***********************

    PYTHON <python-source> <entry-function>(<argv>) -
        Executes a Python script. The entry function is optional and may be used to pass current environment variables to
        the Python script. If the entry function is specified, the server will only execute this function and will close
        the statement as soon as the function returns.


Ruleset Statements:
*******************

    RULESET {...} -
        The base context that is used to build a new ruleset. Rulesets bind certain instructions to specific file and data
        types, which is useful for making the virtual file system operate more efficiently and with less code requirement.

    FILESYS {...} -
        Defines the formatting rules that should be applied to the request URI before it is being mapped to a rule. If no
        formatting rule returns a path that points to an actual location on the file system, the NotFound violation is
        triggered. The FILESYS block stores it's results in the filesys::uri scope. The original request is available through
        the client::request::uri scope.
    See also: "requests & responses.txt", "file systems & streams.txt"

    RULE <function>(<argv>) <- <array>, <selector> {...} -
        Creates a new rule. Rules are blocks that get executed if the first value returned by the function is true. The <- operator
        is optional and may be used to define wildcards. The selector is also optional and may be used to change the return value
        that triggers the RULE block.

    EXTEND -
        Declares the ruleset not complete. If this statement is encountered inside a RULE block, lazy evaluation is switched off
        and the ruleset proceeds matching rules to the file system until a block without EXTEND is executed.

    VIOLATION <violation> {...} -
        The VIOLATION statement implements a form of error handling in the ruleset context. Certain rules may throw exceptions
        which will be caught by the VIOLATION statements.


Permission Statements:
**********************

    GROUP <group> {...} -
        Defines special values and permissions for a specific group of users.

    USER <user> {...} -
        Defines special values and permissions for a specific user.



###  X S E R V E   P R O T C O L   A P I  ###

HTTP Statements:
****************

    HOST <hostname> {...} -
        Maps the client host header to a server ressource. If no host is found, the ERROR 404 statement is called.

    URI <uri> {...} -
        Maps the client request header to a server ressource. If the URI is invalid, the ERROR 404 statement for
        the current tree is called.

    DIR <uri> {...} -
        Defines the properties for all sub-URIs of this URI. Should be used for all dynamic content or for large
        amounts of data which have simmilar URI rulesets.

    ERROR <XXX> {...} -
        The URI properties that are called if the error code XXX is encountered.


FTP Statements:
***************

    FILE <uri> {...} -
        Represents a file on the virtual file system.

    DIR <uri> {...} -
        Represents a directory on the virtual file system. Behaves simmilar to the DIR-statement from the HTTP standard.

    LINK <uri> {...} -
        Represents a symbolic link on the virtual file system.

    ERROR <XXX> {...} -
        The FTP properties that are called if the error code XXX is encountered.


Gopher Statements:
******************

    URI <uri> {...} -
        Maps the client request to a server ressource.

    ERROR <XXX> {...} -
        The Gopher properties that are called if the error code XXX is encountered.


DNS Statements:
***************

    ZONE <type> <zone-file> -
        Reads values from a zone file.


IMAP Statements:
****************

    MAIL <uri> {...} -
        Represents a mail on the virtual file system.

    FOLDER <uri> {...} -
        Represents a mail folder on the virtual file system.

    MBOX <uri> {...} -
        Represents a mail box on the virtual file system.
