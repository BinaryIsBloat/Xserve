The Xserve Parser by RandomGuyWithoutY
**************************************

Introduction & Purpose:

  The Xserve Parser is an additional component for the Xserve Core package. It is not dependent on the Xserve Core API, making
  it portable to other software that supports it. Nonetheless both package APIs are extremely simmilar, making it more convenient
  to implement the Xserve Parser in combination with the Xserve Core package. The Parser has it's very own scripting language
  which should be updated regularely to support recent security features and web protocols.


Instructions:

  Instructions are executed by the parser one-by-one at a time. Instructions may be delimited by semicolon, in which case multiple
  instructions per line are possible. If no semicolon is present in the line, a new instruction will be assumed after the next line
  break. Simmilarly to C, the Xserve Parser ignores every whitespace character that is outside of a string.

Statements:

  Statements are uppercase, non-delimited instructions in the code which take one or more arguments and are oftentimes followed
  by nested instructions in curly braces. There are diffrent types of statements available in certain context. The context is
  usually determined by higher-level statements, such as PROTO or GROUP. Statements may also be defined in external libraries which
  may be added using the INCLUDE statement. And finally, the context is also dependent on the VERSION statement, which maps the
  script to a specific standards page where most of the core statements are saved. The syntax works after the following rules:

     STATEMENT argument1, argument2 {
         ...
     }

  Statements may also be written with the arguments enclosed in round brackets, though that usually isn't necessary.
